<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="section" id="the-world-still-needs-zerocash-even-though-we-now-have-confidential-transactions">
<h3>The world still needs <em>Zerocash</em> even though we now have <em>Confidential Transactions</em>.</h3>
<p><em>A message from Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn:</em></p>
<p>At Least Authority, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">our mission</a> is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to every user of the Internet. As a part of this mission, we are
working on something that we can't announce yet, but it involves the
<a class="reference external" href="http://zca.sh/">Zerocash</a> protocol for private Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>Recently Blockstream announced <a class="reference external" href="http://elementsproject.org/">Sidechains Elements</a>, which includes a
privacy protocol named <a class="reference external" href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt">Confidential Transactions</a>. We invited the lead
author of Confidential Transactions — Greg Maxwell — and the authors of
the Zerocash Protocol to help us explain how Confidential Transactions
compares to Zerocash.</p>
<p>In short, Zerocash offers privacy properties that Confidential
Transactions does not. Most notably, Confidential Transactions only
protects transaction values, whereas Zerocash also protects sender and
receiver addresses – but at the cost of extra cryptographic novelty. In
addition, there are other engineering and cryptography tradeoffs between
the two.</p>

<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Zerocash (ZC) and Confidential Transactions (CT) are both ledger
protocols: they can be used to improve the privacy of any given ledger
system, whether that’s in Bitcoin sidechains, centralized ledgers,
or even Bitcoin itself. Zerocash was introduced as a proposed extension
to Bitcoin, or a Bitcoin-like system, and Confidential Transactions
was introduced as a potential Bitcoin sidechain feature as part of
Blockstream Elements.</p>
<p>At a high level, the goal of Confidential Transactions is to hide the
value of transactions, but it does <em>not</em> hide the participants of a
transaction. The metadata of who-has-paid-whom is often more sensitive
than the balances. It is possible to combine CT with other techniques
(such as CoinJoin mixing) to improve participant confidentiality,
although care must be taken to ensure the two schemes interact securely,
and the degree of privacy depends on how many mixing transactions occur.</p>
<p>By contrast, in Zerocash provides full privacy for both transaction
value and participants.</p>
<p>Finally, an important high-level distinction between the two protocols is
that Confidential Transactions have flexible security parameters per
transaction, whereas Zerocash has uniform security across the whole
system. This may lead to important systemic impacts.</p>

<div class="section" id="explanation">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p id="confidentiality"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Confidential Transactions hide transaction <em>values</em>
whereas Zerocash hides all transaction information (except for timing).</p>
<p>Both Zerocash and Confidential Transactions hide the amount of money
transferred in transactions. However, CT does not hide the address of the
sender and the receiver. So “Transaction Graph Analysis” techniques like
<a class="citation-reference" href="#a" id="id13">[a]</a>, <a class="citation-reference" href="#b" id="id14">[b]</a>, <a class="citation-reference" href="#c" id="id15">[c]</a>, <a class="citation-reference" href="#d" id="id16">[d]</a>, and <a class="citation-reference" href="#e" id="id17">[e]</a> may still potentially be used to connect
and trace them to endpoints like exchanges.</p>
<p>Transaction graph analysis can potentially be thwarted by mixing, for
example by using CoinJoin. But mixing comes with a variety of other
implementation challenges, security hazards, and costs; in particular, mixing
adds to blockchain bloat, and mixing is not implemented in Elements.</p>
<p id="user-flexibility"><strong>User Flexibility.</strong> Zerocash is an “all-or-nothing” protocol. There is
only one level of security, and that provides confidentiality against
unauthorized parties for both amounts and sender/receiver
addresses. Users cannot alter this.</p>
<p>(Note: users of Zerocash <em>can</em> make their transaction records transparent
to chosen authorized parties. The discussion about security levels here
is only about the level of security that the system provides against
snooping by <em>unauthorized</em> parties. Zerocash is designed to provide
nothing but maximal security against snooping by <em>unauthorized</em> parties.)</p>
<p>By contrast, Confidential Transactions allows per-transaction security
tuning, such as by trading off <em>some</em> amount of confidentiality for
smaller overhead <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id19" id="id18">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental difference that affects usability, systemic
behavior, and many implementation issues. A usability difference might be
that in a CT system, a recipient may need to distinguish “how much
privacy” comes with the sender's amount, whereas in Zerocash there is a
known “standard amount of privacy”.</p>
<p>There may be systemic impacts: if many users opt to turn down their
privacy settings, then the few users who leave them high may draw
unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many implementation details this difference
affects. For example, all Zerocash transactions have the same <em>shape</em>
(number of inputs and outputs) and size to aide in indistinguishability,
whereas each CT transaction may have a different shape. This also may
have usability impact because if a user wants to split a value into many
new values, for example, their software must use multiple Zerocash
transactions, whereas CT software may choose to use either a single
transaction or more depending on other privacy or performance goals.</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id18">[6]</a></td><td>Note: Even when a protocol is flexible, it's possible to enforce
a stricter use of a protocol with the ledger consensus rules, so long
as that stricter check relies only on ledger-public information.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p id="transaction-size"><strong>Transaction Size.</strong> Both systems use transactions which contain some
metadata along with one or more <em>proofs</em> related to the inputs or outputs.</p>
<p>Zerocash has only one transaction shape with 2 inputs and 2 outputs,
which is the minimum for splitting and joining values <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id21" id="id20">[7]</a>. Note also
that most <em>payments</em> require 2 outputs to account for change back to
the sender.</p>
<p>For this standard transaction shape, the on-chain cost (blockchain bloat)
of a typical CT transaction is higher than that of Zerocash.</p>
<p>However, for other transactions, especially “sweep” transactions with
1 output and N inputs, a CT transaction is much smaller because range
proofs are unneeded.</p>
<p>Additionally, CT supports transactions with any number of inputs or
outputs, whereas ZC has a fixed shape.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id21" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id20">[7]</a></td><td>The Zerocash protocol could be extended to allow more inputs and
more outputs. This article only considers the current published
protocol.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p id="proof-size"><strong>Proof Size.</strong> The size of a full CT proof is, by default, 2.5Kb, compared
to 288 bytes for Zerocash. However, when a transaction has only a single
output, range proofs can be omitted from a transaction, and the remaining
proof structure requires only a single 33 byte Pedersen commitment.</p>
<p>The proof size for CT can also be run in ‘reduced size’ modes,
although this comes with a privacy tradeoff since it reveals more
information about balances. The Zerocash proof size reflects “full
privacy” mode, and there is no way to decrease the level of protection.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the CT proof can be recycled for a dual use, since it
can contain an encrypted message from the sender to recipient.</p>
<p id="proving-cost"><strong>Proving Cost.</strong> The time it takes to create a transaction is much
larger in Zerocash than in CT, although both take longer than ordinary
Bitcoin transactions. We believe both are tolerable. Given these two
state-of-the-art approaches, there remains a tradeoff between cost and
privacy.</p>
<p id="verification-cost"><strong>Verification Cost.</strong> The transaction verification costs for both ZC and
CT transactions are higher than for Bitcoin, but both are likely
tolerable. On a desktop benchmark, a single thread can validate 175 ZC
pour transactions per second.</p>
<p id="pruning-support"><strong>Pruning Support.</strong> CT provides pruning <em>inherently</em>, whereas ZC does
not have pruning currently.</p>
<p>Pruning allows a “full node” (i.e. a node that independently validates
every new transaction block) to reduce its storage costs by forgetting
about previously-spent transactions. In CT, a transaction output is
publicly known to be either spent or unspent, just as in Bitcoin, and
therefore Bitcoin-style pruning works “out of the box”.</p>
<p>By contrast Zerocash requires verifiers to remember a unique identifier
for every spent value, and in the current design this set grows
indefinitely. The paper presents potential optimizations which can
mitigate these storage requirements by making various tradeoffs (Sections
8.3.1 and 8.3.2 of the <cite>Zerocash</cite> paper in <a class="reference internal" href="#peer-review">Peer Review</a>).</p>
<p>Choices around pruning involve other nuanced trade-offs. For
example, systems which allow pruning spent outputs necessarily expose
information about the transaction graph and constrain what kinds of
sender/receiver graph confidentiality is possible.</p>
<p id="cryptographic-basis"><strong>Cryptographic Basis.</strong> CT and ZC rely on different cryptography. On the
one hand, CT relies on a variant of Schnorr signatures, whose security
can be based on either the elliptic-curve DL problem (<cite>ECDLP</cite>) and the
Random-Oracle (<cite>RO</cite>) assumption. On the other hand, ZC relies
on zkSNARKs whose security is based on variants of the Knowledge Of
Exponent (<cite>KoE</cite>) assumption for bilinear groups (instantiated via certain
pairing-friendly elliptic curves). Both the <cite>RO</cite> and <cite>KoE</cite> assumptions
have been studied by cryptographers for over two decades, but only the
former has seen widespread deployment in practice.</p>
<p id="peer-review"><strong>Peer Review.</strong> CT is a new application of well-understood cryptographic
primitives, and has been reviewed informally by industry experts.</p>
<p>The Zerocash protocol has been published in a peer reviewed academic
conference, as well as building on prior published work. Additionally
published work on <a class="reference internal" href="#parameter-setup">Parameter Setup</a> was presented at a conference this
year:</p>

open source.</p>
<p>The community behind these projects highly value open source software. It
is crucial that security-related software, especially for critical
infrastructure such as global transaction systems, is auditable by
the public.</p>
<p>The ZC authors intend to release an open source prototype.</p>
<p id="parameter-setup"><strong>Parameter Setup.</strong> CT has very simple one-time initial parameter
selection which is amenable to common “nothing up my sleeve” selection
techniques. Zerocash has complex one-time initial parameter setup which
is vulnerable to compromise.</p>
<p>The Zerocash authors have presented new research on a secure multi-party
computation to improve the parameter setup security. This new setup
distributed protocol provides the guarantee that if even one party
involved in the setup follows the protocol correctly, then the setup is
secure. (Conversely all participants must be compromised for parameter
compromise.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Confidential Transactions and Zerocash are two protocols for augmenting
ledgers with better privacy. Confidential Transactions only protects
transaction values, whereas Zerocash also protects sender/receiver
addresses.</p>
<p>In Zerocash, all coins are equal, and values are truly fungible. Users
are presented with an all-or-nothing security choice and only a single
security level to understand. In Confidential Transactions, users have
more flexibility and can tune privacy knobs for their individual needs,
and as a result transactions are distinct and have history, and users (or
their software) needs to manage fine-grained security levels.</p>
<p>From a system-wide perspective, Zerocash's all-or-nothing security
level means all users have strong privacy, even when it's not critical
for them. In Confidential Transactions it may be that only users with
strong privacy needs have strong privacy, and if this set of users is
small enough it may endanger their privacy.</p>
<p>Each has costs and tradeoffs on top of the underlying ledger,
related to fundamental security assumptions, maturity of cryptographic
techniques, amount of blockchain bloat, proving and verifying costs,
and burdens on senders or recipients.</p>
<p>The authors agree that both Zerocash and Confidential Transactions should
be pursued – as well as other future innovations! –  to have the
best chance of providing strong financial privacy and fungibility.</p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>At Least Authority, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">our mission</a> is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to everyone. As a part of this mission, we have been
collaborating with with the scientists behind <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipr-lab.org/">zk-SNARKS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://zca.sh/">Zerocash</a>. These are some of the most promising new
advances in cryptography, and we are exploring whether they can be
used to provide more safety and freedom to all users of the Internet.</p>
<p>We're not ready to post about our specific plans, but we want to
address the recent news that a bug has been discovered in libsnark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>A bug in libsnark</h3>
<p>Recently there was <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">a bug reported</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/parno/">Bryan Parno</a> from Microsoft
Research. Because libsnark is used to implement the cryptography in
<em>Zerocash</em>, some people have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35jnax/openpgp_proposal_for_a_separable_ring_signature/cr5c3kb">worried</a> that this bug could have led
to a critical failure in <em>Zerocash</em>, if <em>Zerocash</em> had already been
deployed before the bug was discovered.</p>
<p>We asked some of the authors of libsnark to comment about the bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-we-work">
<h3>How we work</h3>
<p>Before turning the floor over to the libsnark scientists, I'd like to
make two points myself:</p>
<p>First, in the long run, having independent scientists like Bryan Parno
study the zk-SNARK literature and the libsnark implementation in
search of flaws is the right way for a cryptographic innovation like
this to get vetted and improved. It is encouraging to see this kind of
scientific scrutiny happening, and we are grateful for the work he and
other researchers have done.</p>
<p>Second, before we at Least Authority deploy new software or
cryptography for our users to rely on, we perform our own internal
security audits and solicit external security audits from independent
experts. We have not yet performed that process for libsnark, and we
would do so before deploying any libsnark-based systems to our users.</p>
<p>If you're interested in our history, here are the reports from <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/tag/consultancy.html">some
of the security audits</a> that we've performed on behalf of others, and
here is <a class="reference external" href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/">a contest we organized</a> for others to find security flaws in
our flagship product.</p>
<p>We also notified the authors of another zk-SNARK implementation named
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib">snarklib</a>, so that they could fix <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib/blob/master/QAP_query.hpp#L45">the bug as it applies to
snarklib</a>.</p>

<h2>A statement from the libsnark team</h2>
<p><em>Alessandro Chiesa, Eli Ben-Sasson, Eran Tromer, and Madars Virza writing:</em></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bryan Parno <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">identified</a> a bug in the R1CS-to-QAP reduction in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a>.</li>
<li>Current libsnark includes a full and general fix, in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/commit/af725eeb82bd380a02f8be0d8931c8edf55afd03">commit f55afd03</a>.</li>
<li>The fix has negligible performance implications when the number of constraints is much larger than the number of inputs, as is typical in SNARK applications, including Zerocash.</li>
<li>Known users of libsnark have been notified, so that they may update their code to the latest release.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about the bug and its fix:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/master/src/zk_proof_systems/ppzksnark/r1cs_ppzksnark">One of the preprocessing SNARKs in libsnark</a> represents NP statements to be proved as rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS). Internally, a given R1CS is converted into a Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP), an algebraic representation of the NP statement. If the R1CS has an input of size <em>n</em>, the QAP includes polynomials <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> over a finite field F and, for the soundness of the SNARK to hold, these polynomials must be linearly independent over F. The R1CS-to-QAP reduction, which converts an R1CS into a QAP, should ensure this independence. Until recently, libsnark’s implementation of that reduction had a bug: it did not explicitly ensure this independence.</p>
<p>This bug does not always manifest, because a R1CS may naturally induce a QAP in which <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> are linearly independent. However, the linear independence should be assured generically for all possible R1CS. The straightforward fix to do so is as follows.</p>
<p>In the following, consider an R1CS with <em>M</em> constraints, <em>N</em> variables, and <em>n</em> inputs. (The <em>n</em> inputs correspond to variables that are fixed to known values by the NP statement; the remaining <em>N-n</em> variables are part of the witness, and can take on any value.)  The fix is to add <em>n+1</em> dummy constraints that ensure that the constructed QAP always has linearly independent <em>A_0,...,A_n</em>. This causes the degree of the constructed QAP to increase from <em>M</em> to <em>M+n+1</em>. (An optimization, not implemented in our code, is to only add as many additional constraints as needed to ensure that the constructed QAP satisfies the desired property; this number is at least 0 and at most <em>n+1</em>.)</p>
<p>The increase has negligible performance implications when <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em>. Our experiments show that this is the case for all the applications that we considered. For both <em>SNARKs for TinyRAM</em> [BCTV14, USENIX Security] and <em>Scalable Zero-Knowledge</em> [BCTV14, CRYPTO], the increase in the number of constraints is at most 0.007%. For <em>Zerocash</em> [BCGGMTV14, S&amp;P], the increase is smaller: 0.00022%. More generally, we believe that <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em> for most interesting applications, e.g., for constraint systems that verify cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>For more details, see Remark 2.5 in the extended version (revised on 9 May 2015) of <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879">Succinct Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge for a von Neumann Architecture</a>. (Note that the paper is phrased in terms of arithmetic circuits rather than rank-1 constraint systems, so that the paper’s remark and the explanation above differ slightly.)</p>

<p>Why use <a class="reference external" href="https://blake2.net">BLAKE2</a> instead of Skein, Keccak (SHA-3), MD5, or SHA-1 as a secure
hash function?</p>
<div class="section" id="blake-was-the-best-rated-hash-function-in-the-sha-3-competition">
<h2>BLAKE was the best-rated hash function in the SHA-3 competition</h2>
<p>NIST, in <a class="reference external" href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf">the final report of the SHA-3 competition</a>, said this about the
finalists (which included BLAKE, Keccak, Skein, and Grøstl):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BLAKE had a security margin — the gap between a known-weak reduced version
and the full version — comparable to Keccak and superior to the other
finalists. (§4.3: “BLAKE and Keccak have very large security margins.”)</li>
<li>BLAKE had a depth of analysis — the amount of published research analyzing
its security — comparable to Grøstl and Skein and superior to the other
finalists. (§3.1: “Keccak received a significant amount of cryptanalysis,
although not quite the depth of analysis applied to BLAKE, Grøstl, or
Skein”)</li>
<li>BLAKE had performance (in software) comparable to Skein and superior to the
other finalists. (§5.1.4: “Skein and BLAKE […] have the best overall
software performance.”)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-blake-was-similar-to-sha-2">
<h2>but BLAKE was similar to SHA-2</h2>
<p>So if BLAKE was in the top tier in all three of these measures, why didn't
NIST choose BLAKE to be the winner of the SHA-3 contest? The main reason is
given in §3.4 of the final report: because BLAKE's design was similar to
SHA-2's.</p>
<p>When the SHA-3 project was announced, being like SHA-2 was explicitly listed
as an undesirable property. That made sense at the time, but today, being
like SHA-2 should <em>increase</em> your confidence in a hash function's
security. Here's why:</p>
<p>When the SHA-3 project was announced (in 2007), <a class="reference external" href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199.pdf">MD5</a> and (to a lesser
extent) <a class="reference external" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/yiqun/SHA1AttackProceedingVersion.pdf">SHA-1</a> had just been shockingly revealed to be weak, by a
previously-unknown cryptographer from China, Xiaoyun Wang. There was a
general fear among cryptographers that SHA-2 might be next.  SHA-2's design
is like that of SHA-1 and MD5. SHA-2 was still relatively new (having been
published in 2002) and was not yet widely used compared to MD5 or SHA-1. This
was actually the impetus for launching the SHA-3 competition: to have a new
hash function ready in case SHA-2 was suddenly shown to be unsafe. At the
same time, NIST advised everyone to transition from MD5 and SHA-1 to SHA-2
immediately, instead of waiting for the eventual standardization of SHA-3.</p>
<p>This explains why it was a design criterion for SHA-3 candidates to be
<em>different</em> from SHA-2: because the purpose of SHA-3 was to be available as a
fallback in case SHA-2 failed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-being-similar-to-sha-2-is-good">
<h2>but being similar to SHA-2 is good!</h2>
<p>Now, however, another seven years have gone by, and further efforts by
cryptographers to analyze SHA-2 have not found any way to defeat it.  This
means that SHA-2 is now twelve years old, and during most of that time it has
been the most widely recommended secure hash function in the world. So today,
the fact that BLAKE has a few design elements in common with SHA-2 doesn't
seem to reflect badly on BLAKE at all.</p>
<!-- This would be a perfect place to be able to link to your tables of comparison, thereby giving context to "twelve years".
I would be happy to help you with that post, too. —Am -->
<p>BLAKE compares well to the modern hash functions Keccak and Skein.  There is
good reason to think that it is secure, and it has better performance (in
software, on Intel or ARM CPUs) than Keccak. However, the other two are also
good—there is no reason to suspect any of them of any weakness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blake2-is-faster-than-md5">
<h2>BLAKE2 is faster than MD5</h2>
<p>Okay, so what is <em>BLAKE2</em> then? Well, after NIST settled on Keccak to be the
winner of the SHA-3 contest, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Christian
Winnerlein, and I decided that what the world needed was not just a secure
hash function that was faster than Keccak, but one that was faster than MD5!
This is because MD5 (and SHA-1) continue to be very widely used, even in new
applications, even though MD5 and SHA-1 are unsafe for many uses. We
hypothesized that offering engineers a hash function that was <em>both</em> faster
and more secure than their beloved MD5 or SHA-1 might be more effective than
haranguing them to upgrade to an alternative that is more secure but slower.</p>
<p>So, we took BLAKE (Jean-Philippe Aumasson had been one of the designers of
BLAKE), traded-off a little of its generous security margin in return for
more efficiency, and optimized it to produce <em>BLAKE2</em>, which is faster than
MD5 (on a modern Intel CPU). On top of that, we added an optional parallel
mode so that if you have 4 or 8 CPU cores available you can run your BLAKE2
function almost 4 or 8 times as fast.</p>
<p>Bottom line:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MD5 and SHA-1 are not responsible choices for a secure hash function today
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[*]</a>.</li>
<li>Keccak (SHA-3), Skein, and BLAKE2 are all reasonable choices.</li>
<li>BLAKE2 is not only faster than the other good hash functions, it is even
faster than MD5 or SHA-1 (on modern Intel CPUs).</li>
</ul>

unwise to rely on this for two reasons. One is that there could be

<div class="section" id="p-s-this-isn-t-about-hashing-passwords">
<h2>P.S. this isn't about hashing passwords</h2>
<p>P.S. Secure hash functions are not for hashing passwords! Secure hash
functions are building blocks in cryptographic protocols and they should be
as efficient as possible while still being secure.  <em>Password-hashing
functions</em> are for impeding brute force guessing of passwords, and they
should be as inefficient as possible while still being usable. See &quot;scrypt&quot;
and &quot;bcrypt&quot; for current password-hashing functions, and see the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Hashing_Competition">Password
Hashing Competition</a> for some candidate next-generation ones.</p>
<p>By the way, some of the entrants in the Password Hashing Competition use
BLAKE2 as an internal building block in their algorithm. They presumably
chose it because it is fast, and then their design forces the computer to
calculate BLAKE2 many, many times, iteratively, in order to be slow
again. This actually makes sense. ☺</p>
