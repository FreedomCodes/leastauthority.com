<div class="section" id="about-us">
<h3>About us</h3>
<p>At Least Authority, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">our mission</a> is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to everyone. As a part of this mission, we have been
collaborating with with the scientists behind <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipr-lab.org/">zk-SNARKS</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://zca.sh/">Zerocash</a>. These are some of the most promising new
advances in cryptography, and we are exploring whether they can be
used to provide more safety and freedom to all users of the Internet.</p>
<p>We're not ready to post about our specific plans, but we want to
address the recent news that a bug has been discovered in libsnark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>A bug in libsnark</h3>
<p>Recently there was <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">a bug reported</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/parno/">Bryan Parno</a> from Microsoft
Research. Because libsnark is used to implement the cryptography in
<em>Zerocash</em>, some people have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35jnax/openpgp_proposal_for_a_separable_ring_signature/cr5c3kb">worried</a> that this bug could have led
to a critical failure in <em>Zerocash</em>, if <em>Zerocash</em> had already been
deployed before the bug was discovered.</p>
<p>We asked some of the authors of libsnark to comment about the bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-we-work">
<h3>How we work</h3>
<p>Before turning the floor over to the libsnark scientists, I'd like to
make two points myself:</p>
<p>First, in the long run, having independent scientists like Bryan Parno
study the zk-SNARK literature and the libsnark implementation in
search of flaws is the right way for a cryptographic innovation like
this to get vetted and improved. It is encouraging to see this kind of
scientific scrutiny happening, and we are grateful for the work he and
other researchers have done.</p>
<p>Second, before we at Least Authority deploy new software or
cryptography for our users to rely on, we perform our own internal
security audits and solicit external security audits from independent
experts. We have not yet performed that process for libsnark, and we
would do so before deploying any libsnark-based systems to our users.</p>
<p>If you're interested in our history, here are the reports from <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/tag/consultancy.html">some
of the security audits</a> that we've performed on behalf of others, and
here is <a class="reference external" href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/">a contest we organized</a> for others to find security flaws in
our flagship product.</p>
<p>We also notified the authors of another zk-SNARK implementation named
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib">snarklib</a>, so that they could fix <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib/blob/master/QAP_query.hpp#L45">the bug as it applies to
snarklib</a>.</p>

<h2>A statement from the libsnark team</h2>
<p><em>Alessandro Chiessa, Eli Ben-Sasson, Eran Tromer, and Madars Virza writing:</em></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bryan Parno <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">identified</a> a bug in the R1CS-to-QAP reduction in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a>.</li>
<li>Current libsnark includes a full and general fix, in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/commit/af725eeb82bd380a02f8be0d8931c8edf55afd03">commit f55afd03</a>.</li>
<li>The fix has negligible performance implications when the number of constraints is much larger than the number of inputs, as is typical in SNARK applications, including Zerocash.</li>
<li>Known users of libsnark have been notified, so that they may update their code to the latest release.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about the bug and its fix:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/master/src/zk_proof_systems/ppzksnark/r1cs_ppzksnark">One of the preprocessing SNARKs in libsnark</a> represents NP statements to be proved as rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS). Internally, a given R1CS is converted into a Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP), an algebraic representation of the NP statement. If the R1CS has an input of size <em>n</em>, the QAP includes polynomials <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> over a finite field F and, for the soundness of the SNARK to hold, these polynomials must be linearly independent over F. The R1CS-to-QAP reduction, which converts an R1CS into a QAP, should ensure this independence. Until recently, libsnark’s implementation of that reduction had a bug: it did not explicitly ensure this independence.</p>
<p>This bug does not always manifest, because a R1CS may naturally induce a QAP in which <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> are linearly independent. However, the linear independence should be assured generically for all possible R1CS. The straightforward fix to do so is as follows.</p>
<p>In the following, consider an R1CS with <em>M</em> constraints, <em>N</em> variables, and <em>n</em> inputs. (The <em>n</em> inputs correspond to variables that are fixed to known values by the NP statement; the remaining <em>N-n</em> variables are part of the witness, and can take on any value.)  The fix is to add <em>n+1</em> dummy constraints (instead of one dummy constraint as in the previous code) that ensure that the constructed QAP always has linearly independent <em>A_0,...,A_n</em>. This causes the degree of the constructed QAP to increase from <em>M+1</em> to <em>M+n+1</em>. (An optimization, not implemented in our code, is to only add as many additional constraints as needed to ensure that the constructed QAP satisfies the desired property; this number is at least 0 and at most <em>n+1</em>.)</p>
<p>The increase has negligible performance implications when <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em>. Our experiments show that this is the case for all the applications that we considered. For both <em>SNARKs for TinyRAM</em> [BCTV14, USENIX Security] and <em>Scalable Zero-Knowledge</em> [BCTV14, CRYPTO], the increase in the number of constraints is at most 0.007%. For <em>Zerocash</em> [BCGGMTV14, S&amp;P], the increase is smaller: 0.00022%. More generally, we believe that <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em> for most interesting applications, e.g., for constraint systems that verify cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>For more details, see Remark 2.5 in the extended version (revised on 9 May 2015) of <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879">Succinct Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge for a von Neumann Architecture</a>. (Note that the paper is phrased in terms of arithmetic circuits rather than rank-1 constraint systems, so that the paper’s remark and the explanation above differ slightly.)</p>

<p>Why use <a class="reference external" href="https://blake2.net">BLAKE2</a> instead of Skein, Keccak (SHA-3), MD5, or SHA-1 as a secure
hash function?</p>
<div class="section" id="blake-was-the-best-rated-hash-function-in-the-sha-3-competition">
<h2>BLAKE was the best-rated hash function in the SHA-3 competition</h2>
<p>NIST, in <a class="reference external" href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2012/NIST.IR.7896.pdf">the final report of the SHA-3 competition</a>, said this about the
finalists (which included BLAKE, Keccak, Skein, and Grøstl):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BLAKE had a security margin — the gap between a known-weak reduced version
and the full version — comparable to Keccak and superior to the other
finalists. (§4.3: “BLAKE and Keccak have very large security margins.”)</li>
<li>BLAKE had a depth of analysis — the amount of published research analyzing
its security — comparable to Grøstl and Skein and superior to the other
finalists. (§3.1: “Keccak received a significant amount of cryptanalysis,
although not quite the depth of analysis applied to BLAKE, Grøstl, or
Skein”)</li>
<li>BLAKE had performance (in software) comparable to Skein and superior to the
other finalists. (§5.1.4: “Skein and BLAKE […] have the best overall
software performance.”)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-blake-was-similar-to-sha-2">
<h2>but BLAKE was similar to SHA-2</h2>
<p>So if BLAKE was in the top tier in all three of these measures, why didn't
NIST choose BLAKE to be the winner of the SHA-3 contest? The main reason is
given in §3.4 of the final report: because BLAKE's design was similar to
SHA-2's.</p>
<p>When the SHA-3 project was announced, being like SHA-2 was explicitly listed
as an undesirable property. That made sense at the time, but today, being
like SHA-2 should <em>increase</em> your confidence in a hash function's
security. Here's why:</p>
<p>When the SHA-3 project was announced (in 2007), <a class="reference external" href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/199.pdf">MD5</a> and (to a lesser
extent) <a class="reference external" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/yiqun/SHA1AttackProceedingVersion.pdf">SHA-1</a> had just been shockingly revealed to be weak, by a
previously-unknown cryptographer from China, Xiaoyun Wang. There was a
general fear among cryptographers that SHA-2 might be next.  SHA-2's design
is like that of SHA-1 and MD5. SHA-2 was still relatively new (having been
published in 2002) and was not yet widely used compared to MD5 or SHA-1. This
was actually the impetus for launching the SHA-3 competition: to have a new
hash function ready in case SHA-2 was suddenly shown to be unsafe. At the
same time, NIST advised everyone to transition from MD5 and SHA-1 to SHA-2
immediately, instead of waiting for the eventual standardization of SHA-3.</p>
<p>This explains why it was a design criterion for SHA-3 candidates to be
<em>different</em> from SHA-2: because the purpose of SHA-3 was to be available as a
fallback in case SHA-2 failed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-being-similar-to-sha-2-is-good">
<h2>but being similar to SHA-2 is good!</h2>
<p>Now, however, another seven years have gone by, and further efforts by
cryptographers to analyze SHA-2 have not found any way to defeat it.  This
means that SHA-2 is now twelve years old, and during most of that time it has
been the most widely recommended secure hash function in the world. So today,
the fact that BLAKE has a few design elements in common with SHA-2 doesn't
seem to reflect badly on BLAKE at all.</p>
<!-- This would be a perfect place to be able to link to your tables of comparison, thereby giving context to "twelve years".
I would be happy to help you with that post, too. —Am -->
<p>BLAKE compares well to the modern hash functions Keccak and Skein.  There is
good reason to think that it is secure, and it has better performance (in
software, on Intel or ARM CPUs) than Keccak. However, the other two are also
good—there is no reason to suspect any of them of any weakness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blake2-is-faster-than-md5">
<h2>BLAKE2 is faster than MD5</h2>
<p>Okay, so what is <em>BLAKE2</em> then? Well, after NIST settled on Keccak to be the
winner of the SHA-3 contest, Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Christian
Winnerlein, and I decided that what the world needed was not just a secure
hash function that was faster than Keccak, but one that was faster than MD5!
This is because MD5 (and SHA-1) continue to be very widely used, even in new
applications, even though MD5 and SHA-1 are unsafe for many uses. We
hypothesized that offering engineers a hash function that was <em>both</em> faster
and more secure than their beloved MD5 or SHA-1 might be more effective than
haranguing them to upgrade to an alternative that is more secure but slower.</p>
<p>So, we took BLAKE (Jean-Philippe Aumasson had been one of the designers of
BLAKE), traded-off a little of its generous security margin in return for
more efficiency, and optimized it to produce <em>BLAKE2</em>, which is faster than
MD5 (on a modern Intel CPU). On top of that, we added an optional parallel
mode so that if you have 4 or 8 CPU cores available you can run your BLAKE2
function almost 4 or 8 times as fast.</p>
<p>Bottom line:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MD5 and SHA-1 are not responsible choices for a secure hash function today
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[*]</a>.</li>
<li>Keccak (SHA-3), Skein, and BLAKE2 are all reasonable choices.</li>
<li>BLAKE2 is not only faster than the other good hash functions, it is even
faster than MD5 or SHA-1 (on modern Intel CPUs).</li>
</ul>

unwise to rely on this for two reasons. One is that there could be

<h2>P.S. this isn't about hashing passwords</h2>
<p>P.S. Secure hash functions are not for hashing passwords! Secure hash
functions are building blocks in cryptographic protocols and they should be
as efficient as possible while still being secure.  <em>Password-hashing
functions</em> are for impeding brute force guessing of passwords, and they
should be as inefficient as possible while still being usable. See &quot;scrypt&quot;
and &quot;bcrypt&quot; for current password-hashing functions, and see the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Hashing_Competition">Password
Hashing Competition</a> for some candidate next-generation ones.</p>
<p>By the way, some of the entrants in the Password Hashing Competition use
BLAKE2 as an internal building block in their algorithm. They presumably
chose it because it is fast, and then their design forces the computer to
calculate BLAKE2 many, many times, iteratively, in order to be slow
again. This actually makes sense. ☺</p>
