Snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tahoe's protections against third-party snooping and deletion have the kind of strong mathematical guarantees that reassure security experts that Tahoe-LAFS is well-defended against certain kinds of attack. That also means its privacy and resilience are not dependent on the good behaviour or policies of its operators&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This both gives Linux a retaliatory weapon against future patent trolls and forestalls intellectual property related fear and uncertainty among potential corporate users of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a bit of a quibble with the article's first line, though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looking for a solution to give you an edge in the ongoing struggle between you and the authorities over the privacy of your data?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to us to note that S4 and LAFS are not only meant to thwart mass government surveillance. We seek to protect against access by the &lt;em&gt;unauthorized&lt;/em&gt;, not merely &amp;quot;the authorities&amp;quot;. That means individual crackers, criminal organizations, corporate rivals, or non-PRISM-affiliated foreign governments just as much as the NSA! Least Authority is pro-security across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no way that one could build an effective anti-government security system without excluding those other threats as well. Similarly, if law enforcement is authorized to see the data, then hackers also can see the data.&lt;/p&gt;
