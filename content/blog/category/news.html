<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="section" id="the-world-still-needs-zerocash-even-though-we-now-have-confidential-transactions">
<h3>The world still needs <em>Zerocash</em> even though we now have <em>Confidential Transactions</em>.</h3>
<p><em>A message from Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn:</em></p>
<p>At Least Authority, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">our mission</a> is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to every user of the Internet. As a part of this mission, we are
working on something that we can't announce yet, but it involves the
<a class="reference external" href="http://zca.sh/">Zerocash</a> protocol for private Bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p>Recently Blockstream announced <a class="reference external" href="http://elementsproject.org/">Sidechains Elements</a>, which includes a
privacy protocol named <a class="reference external" href="https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt">Confidential Transactions</a>. We invited the lead
author of Confidential Transactions — Greg Maxwell — and the authors of
the Zerocash Protocol to help us explain how Confidential Transactions
compares to Zerocash.</p>
<p>In short, Zerocash offers privacy properties that Confidential
Transactions does not. Most notably, Confidential Transactions only
protects transaction values, whereas Zerocash also protects sender and
receiver addresses – but at the cost of extra cryptographic novelty. In
addition, there are other engineering and cryptography tradeoffs between
the two.</p>
<p>—Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, Founder and CEO of LeastAuthority</p>

<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Zerocash (ZC) and Confidential Transactions (CT) are both ledger
protocols: they can be used to improve the privacy of any given ledger
system, whether that’s in Bitcoin sidechains, centralized ledgers,
or even Bitcoin itself. Zerocash was introduced as a proposed extension
to Bitcoin, or a Bitcoin-like system, and Confidential Transactions
was introduced as a potential Bitcoin sidechain feature as part of
BlockStream Elements.</p>
<p>At a high level, the goal of Confidential Transactions is to hide the
value of transactions, but it does <em>not</em> hide the participants of a
transaction. The metadata of who-has-paid-whom is often more sensitive
than the balances. It is possible to combine CT with other techniques
(such as CoinJoin mixing) to improve participant confidentiality,
although care must be taken to ensure the two schemes interact securely,
and the degree of privacy depends on how many mixing transactions occur.</p>
<p>By contrast, in Zerocash provides full privacy for both transaction
value and participants.</p>
<p>Finally, an important high-level distinction between the two protocols is
that Confidential Transactions have flexible security parameters per
transaction, whereas Zerocash has uniform security across the whole
system. This may lead to important systemic impacts.</p>

<div class="section" id="explanation">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p id="confidentiality"><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> Confidential Transactions hide transaction <em>values</em>
whereas Zerocash hides all transaction information (except for timing).</p>
<p>Both Zerocash and Confidential Transactions hide the amount of money
transferred in transactions. However, CT does not hide the address of the
sender and the receiver. So “Transaction Graph Analysis” techniques like
[<a class="reference external" href="Ron,Dorit,andAdiShamir.Quantitativeanalysisofthefullbitcointransactiongraph.FinancialCryptographyandDataSecurity.2013.http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584">a</a>,b_,c_,d_,e_] may still potentially be used to connect and
trace them to endpoints like exchanges.</p>
<p>XXX The references above don't work in my browser. My issue only or not?</p>
<p>Transaction graph analysis can be potentially be thwarted by mixing, for
example by using CoinJoin. But mixing comes with a variety of other
implementation challenges, security hazards, and costs; in particular, mixing
adds to blockchain bloat, and mixing is not implemented in Elements.</p>
<p id="user-flexibility"><strong>User Flexibility.</strong> Zerocash is an “all-or-nothing” protocol. There is
only one level of security, and that provides confidentiality against
unauthorized parties for both amounts and sender/receiver
addresses. Users cannot alter this.</p>
<p>(Note: users of Zerocash <em>can</em> make their transaction records transparent
to chosen authorized parties. The discussion about security levels here
is only about the level of security that the system provides against
snooping by <em>unauthorized</em> parties. Zerocash is designed to provide
nothing but maximal security against snooping by <em>unauthorized</em> parties.)</p>
<p>By contrast, Confidential Transactions allows per-transaction security
tuning, such as by trading off <em>some</em> amount confidentiality for smaller
overhead <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id13">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>This is a fundamental difference that affects usability, systemic
behavior, and many implementation issues. A usability difference might be
that in a CT system, a recipient may need to distinguish “how much
privacy” comes with the sender's amount, whereas in Zerocash there is a
known “standard amount of privacy”.</p>
<p>There may be systemic impacts: if many users opt to turn down their
privacy settings, then the few users who leave them high may draw
unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many implementation details this difference
affects. For example, all Zerocash transactions have the same <em>shape</em>
(number of inputs and outputs) and size to aide in indistinguishability,
whereas each CT transaction may have a different shape. This also may
have usability impact because if a user wants to split a value into many
new values, for example, their software must use multiple Zerocash
transactions, whereas CT software may choose to use either a single
transaction or more depending on other privacy or performance goals.</p>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id14" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id13">[6]</a></td><td>Note: Even when a protocol is flexible, it's possible to enforce
a stricter use of a protocol with the ledger consensus rules, so long
as that stricter check relies only on ledger-public information.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p id="transaction-size"><strong>Transaction Size.</strong> Both systems use transactions which contain some
metadata along with one or more <em>proofs</em> related to the inputs or outputs.</p>
<p>Zerocash has only one transaction shape with 2 inputs and 2 outputs,
which is the minimum for splitting and joining values. Note also that most
<em>payments</em> require 2 outputs to account for change back to the sender.</p>
<p>(In the future, we may extend Zerocash to allow more inputs and more
outputs, but this discussion is about the current version of Zerocash.)</p>
<p>For this standard transaction shape, the on-chain cost (blockchain bloat)
of a typical CT transaction is higher than that of Zerocash.</p>
<p>However, for other transactions, especially “sweep” transactions with
1 output and N inputs, a CT transaction is much smaller because range
proofs are unneeded.</p>
<p>Additionally, CT supports transactions with any number of inputs or
outputs, whereas ZC has a fixed shape.</p>
<p id="proof-size"><strong>Proof Size.</strong> The size of a full CT proof is, by default, 2.5Kb, compared
to 288 bytes for Zerocash. However, when a transaction has only a single
output, range proofs can be omitted from a transaction, and the remaining
proof structure requires only a single 33 byte Pedersen commitment.</p>
<p>The proof size for CT can also be run in ‘reduced size’ modes,
although this comes with a privacy tradeoff since it reveals more
information about balances. The Zerocash proof size reflects “full
privacy” mode, and there is no way to decrease the level of protection.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the CT proof can be recycled for a dual use, since it
can contain an encrypted message from the sender to recipient.</p>
<p id="proving-cost"><strong>Proving Cost.</strong> The time it takes to create a transaction is much
larger in Zerocash than in CT, although both take longer than ordinary
Bitcoin transactions. We believe both are tolerable. Given these two
state-of-the-art approaches, there remains a tradeoff between cost and
privacy.</p>
<p id="verification-cost"><strong>Verification Cost.</strong> The transaction verification costs for both ZC and
CT transactions are higher than for Bitcoin, but both are likely
tolerable. On a desktop benchmark, a single thread can validate 175 ZC
pour transactions per second.</p>
<p id="pruning-support"><strong>Pruning Support.</strong> CT provides pruning <em>inherently</em>, whereas ZC does
not have pruning currently.</p>
<p>Pruning allows a “full node” (i.e. a node that independently validates
every new transaction block) to reduce its storage costs by forgetting
about previously-spent transactions. In CT, a transaction output is
publicly known to be either spent or unspent, just as in Bitcoin, and
therefore Bitcoin-style pruning works “out of the box”.</p>
<p>By contrast Zerocash requires verifiers to remember a unique identifier
for every spent value, and in the current design this set grows
indefinitely. The paper presents potential optimizations which can
mitigate these storage requirements by making various tradeoffs (Sections
8.3.1 and 8.3.2 of the <cite>Zerocash</cite> paper in <a class="reference internal" href="#peer-review">Peer Review</a>).</p>
<p>Choices around pruning involve other nuanced trade-offs. For
example, systems which allow pruning spent outputs necessarily expose
information about the transaction graph and constrain what kinds of
sender/receiver graph confidentiality is possible.</p>
<p id="cryptographic-basis"><strong>Cryptographic Basis.</strong> CT and ZC rely on different cryptographic
primitives with different levels of maturity and acceptance.</p>
<p>Both rely on elliptic curve cryptography, <cite>ECC</cite>; CT relies on a ubiquitous
assumption -- <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography">ECDLP</a>, whereas ZC relies on newer ECC assumptions such
as Knowledge Of Exponent, <cite>KOE</cite>.</p>
<p>Notably, CT relies on the <em>same assumptions</em> as Bitcoin's signature
scheme, and does not introduce new fundamental assumptions, although
it does involve a novel ring signature generalization and various
optimizations which deserve scrutiny.</p>
<p>By contrast, Zerocash relies on zkSNARKs, which are also based on the
<cite>KOE</cite> security assumption. These are relatively new in research, and
Zerocash is the first known practical application of this new technique.</p>
<p id="peer-review"><strong>Peer Review.</strong> CT is a new application of well-understood cryptographic
primitives, and has been reviewed informally by industry experts.</p>
<p>The Zerocash protocol has been published in a peer reviewed academic
conference, as well as building on prior published work. Additionally
published work on <a class="reference internal" href="#parameter-setup">Parameter Setup</a> was presented at a conference this
year:</p>

</ul>
<p>zkSNARKs have been covered by many <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scipr-lab.org/publications.html">peer-reviewed publications</a>.</p>
<p id="code-auditability"><strong>Code Auditability.</strong> CT is open source. The ZC code is not yet
public.</p>
<p>The community behind these projects highly value open source software. It
is crucial that security-related software, especially for critical
infrastructure such as global transaction systems, is auditable by
the public.</p>
<p>The ZC authors intend to release an open source prototype.</p>
<p id="parameter-setup"><strong>Parameter Setup.</strong> CT has very simple one-time initial parameter
selection which are amenable to common “nothing up my sleeve” selection
techniques. Zerocash has complex one-time initial parameter setup which
is vulnerable to compromise.</p>
<p>The Zerocash authors have presented new research on a secure multi-party
computation to improve the parameter setup security. This new setup
distributed protocol provides the guarantee that if even one party
involved in the setup follows the protocol correctly, then the setup is
secure. (Conversely all participants must be compromised for parameter
compromise.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Confidential Transactions and Zerocash are two protocols for augmenting
ledgers with better privacy. Confidential Transactions only protects
transaction values, whereas Zerocash also protects sender/receiver
addresses.</p>
<p>In Zerocash, all coins are equal, and values are truly fungible. Users
are presented with an all-or-nothing security choice and only a single
security level to understand. In Confidential Transactions, users have
more flexibility and can tune privacy knobs for their individual needs,
and as a result transactions are distinct and have history, and users (or
their software) needs to manage fine-grained security levels.</p>
<p>From a system-wide perspective, Zerocash's all-or-nothing security
level means all users have strong privacy, even when it's not critical
for them. In Confidential Transactions it may be that only users with
strong privacy needs have strong privacy, and if this set of users is
small enough it may endanger their privacy.</p>
<p>Each has costs and tradeoffs on top of the underlying ledger,
related to fundamental security assumptions, maturity of cryptographic
techniques, amount of blockchain bloat, proving and verifying costs,
and burdens on senders or recipients.</p>
<p>The authors agree that both Zerocash and Confidential Transactions should
be pursued – as well as other future innovations! –  to have the
best chance of providing strong financial privacy.</p>

<p>Recently there was <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">a bug reported</a> by <a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/parno/">Bryan Parno</a> from Microsoft
Research. Because libsnark is used to implement the cryptography in
<em>Zerocash</em>, some people have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35jnax/openpgp_proposal_for_a_separable_ring_signature/cr5c3kb">worried</a> that this bug could have led
to a critical failure in <em>Zerocash</em>, if <em>Zerocash</em> had already been
deployed before the bug was discovered.</p>
<p>We asked some of the authors of libsnark to comment about the bug.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-we-work">
<h3>How we work</h3>
<p>Before turning the floor over to the libsnark scientists, I'd like to
make two points myself:</p>
<p>First, in the long run, having independent scientists like Bryan Parno
study the zk-SNARK literature and the libsnark implementation in
search of flaws is the right way for a cryptographic innovation like
this to get vetted and improved. It is encouraging to see this kind of
scientific scrutiny happening, and we are grateful for the work he and
other researchers have done.</p>
<p>Second, before we at Least Authority deploy new software or
cryptography for our users to rely on, we perform our own internal
security audits and solicit external security audits from independent
experts. We have not yet performed that process for libsnark, and we
would do so before deploying any libsnark-based systems to our users.</p>
<p>If you're interested in our history, here are the reports from <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/tag/consultancy.html">some
of the security audits</a> that we've performed on behalf of others, and
here is <a class="reference external" href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/">a contest we organized</a> for others to find security flaws in
our flagship product.</p>
<p>We also notified the authors of another zk-SNARK implementation named
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib">snarklib</a>, so that they could fix <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jancarlsson/snarklib/blob/master/QAP_query.hpp#L45">the bug as it applies to
snarklib</a>.</p>

<h2>A statement from the libsnark team</h2>
<p><em>Alessandro Chiesa, Eli Ben-Sasson, Eran Tromer, and Madars Virza writing:</em></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bryan Parno <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/437">identified</a> a bug in the R1CS-to-QAP reduction in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a>.</li>
<li>Current libsnark includes a full and general fix, in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/commit/af725eeb82bd380a02f8be0d8931c8edf55afd03">commit f55afd03</a>.</li>
<li>The fix has negligible performance implications when the number of constraints is much larger than the number of inputs, as is typical in SNARK applications, including Zerocash.</li>
<li>Known users of libsnark have been notified, so that they may update their code to the latest release.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details about the bug and its fix:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/master/src/zk_proof_systems/ppzksnark/r1cs_ppzksnark">One of the preprocessing SNARKs in libsnark</a> represents NP statements to be proved as rank-1 constraint systems (R1CS). Internally, a given R1CS is converted into a Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP), an algebraic representation of the NP statement. If the R1CS has an input of size <em>n</em>, the QAP includes polynomials <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> over a finite field F and, for the soundness of the SNARK to hold, these polynomials must be linearly independent over F. The R1CS-to-QAP reduction, which converts an R1CS into a QAP, should ensure this independence. Until recently, libsnark’s implementation of that reduction had a bug: it did not explicitly ensure this independence.</p>
<p>This bug does not always manifest, because a R1CS may naturally induce a QAP in which <em>A_0,...,A_n</em> are linearly independent. However, the linear independence should be assured generically for all possible R1CS. The straightforward fix to do so is as follows.</p>
<p>In the following, consider an R1CS with <em>M</em> constraints, <em>N</em> variables, and <em>n</em> inputs. (The <em>n</em> inputs correspond to variables that are fixed to known values by the NP statement; the remaining <em>N-n</em> variables are part of the witness, and can take on any value.)  The fix is to add <em>n+1</em> dummy constraints that ensure that the constructed QAP always has linearly independent <em>A_0,...,A_n</em>. This causes the degree of the constructed QAP to increase from <em>M</em> to <em>M+n+1</em>. (An optimization, not implemented in our code, is to only add as many additional constraints as needed to ensure that the constructed QAP satisfies the desired property; this number is at least 0 and at most <em>n+1</em>.)</p>
<p>The increase has negligible performance implications when <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em>. Our experiments show that this is the case for all the applications that we considered. For both <em>SNARKs for TinyRAM</em> [BCTV14, USENIX Security] and <em>Scalable Zero-Knowledge</em> [BCTV14, CRYPTO], the increase in the number of constraints is at most 0.007%. For <em>Zerocash</em> [BCGGMTV14, S&amp;P], the increase is smaller: 0.00022%. More generally, we believe that <em>M</em> is much larger than <em>n</em> for most interesting applications, e.g., for constraint systems that verify cryptographic computations.</p>
<p>For more details, see Remark 2.5 in the extended version (revised on 9 May 2015) of <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879">Succinct Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge for a von Neumann Architecture</a>. (Note that the paper is phrased in terms of arithmetic circuits rather than rank-1 constraint systems, so that the paper’s remark and the explanation above differ slightly.)</p>

                    <p>At Least Authority, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">our mission</a> is to bring verifiable end-to-end security to
everyone. As a part of this mission, we provide security consulting services to
free and open-source software projects. We also run a verifiably-secure cloud
backup system, <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/product_s4">S4</a>.</p>
<p>In the past, we've performed successful security audits of <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_spideroak.html">SpiderOak's Crypton
project</a> and of <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_cryptocat.html">Cryptocat</a>. Continuing this series of security audits, we've
completed an audit of the <a class="reference external" href="https://globaleaks.org/">GlobaLeaks whistleblowing framework</a>.</p>
<p>This audit was funded by the Open Technology Fund (OTF). Regular security audits
are an important part of the development of any software, and free and open
source internet freedom software is certainly no exception. We applaud OTF for
funding these highly beneficial audits.</p>
<div class="section" id="audit-results">
<h2>Audit Results</h2>
<p>Protecting whistleblowers is no easy task, especially since they may be up
against powerful adversaries (governments, corporations, and criminal
organisations) and the consequences of getting caught may be grave. It's
unlikely that a single technical solution to this problem exists. To keep
whistleblowers safe, any technical solution needs to be paired with OPSEC
education.</p>
<p>One of the things we liked about the GlobaLeaks project is that it has OPSEC
education and checks built right in to the user interface.</p>
<p>We identified several security issues in the GlobaLeaks software. You can read
about each issue in the <a class="reference external" href="/static/publications/LeastAuthority-GlobaLeaks-audit-report.pdf">audit report</a>. The issues have been addressed by the
GlobaLeaks team in the latest stable version.</p>

<p>This is the second post in our series about security audits of Free and
Open Source end-to-end encryption software. The first post in the series
was about our security audit of SpiderOak's <a class="reference external" href="/blog/least_authority_performs_security_audit_for_spideroak.html">crypton</a> project.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">Our mission</a> at LeastAuthority is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to everyone.</p>
<p>As part of that mission, in addition to operating the <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/product_s4">S4</a> simple secure
storage service, we also perform security consulting. We
LeastAuthoritarians have extensive experience in security and
cryptography, and other companies sometimes ask us to analyze the
security of their protocols and software.</p>
<p>We audited the widely-used <a class="reference external" href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a> encrypted chat program. This
audit was funded by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opentechfund.org/">Open Technology Fund</a> as part of their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.opentechfund.org/labs#redteam">Red Team</a>
project to provide multiple professional security audits to Internet
freedom projects.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-were-the-results">
<h2>What were the results?</h2>
<p>We found several security issues in the version of Cryptocat that we
examined (Cryptocat v2.1.15). For each one, we reported it to the
Cryptocat developers, and they have either deployed a fix in a newer
release of Cryptocat or else disabled the feature that has the
vulnerability.</p>
<p>The complete list of the issues we found is at the end of this article,
along with a link to the report document.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we didn't have time to examine all parts of Cryptocat that
we wanted to. We concentrated on the “crypto-related” parts: key
generation and key management, random number generation, encryption and
decryption, authentication and integrity, and the new file transfer
feature. Most of the issues that we found were in those areas.</p>
<p>Our report explains what parts of it we looked at most closely (this is
called the &quot;coverage&quot; results of the audit).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parting-thoughts">
<h2>parting thoughts</h2>
<p>I would like to thank the Cryptocat project, led by Nadim Kobeissi, for
their commitment to doing development in the open, inviting external
review, and moving to address the issues we uncovered. This open
development process is a good complement to Cryptocat's Free and Open
Source publication of their code and their commitment to providing
end-to-end security for their users.</p>
<p>On top of that, I'd like to thank Cryptocat for their unflagging focus on
<em>usability</em>. Usability is a critical factor if we are going to succeed at
bringing verifiable end-to-end security to everyone, and it is an area
where we as a community and as a society need to improve.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="any-questions">
<h2>Any questions?</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about these results or the process, please
